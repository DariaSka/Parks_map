hpee8lp,t3_rl8ftz,cascadiacomrade,"Favourite National Park has got to be Banff/Jasper. The mountains, lakes, and glaciers are breathtaking along the Icefields Parkway which has got to be one of the most beautiful roads on Earth. There is so much to explore in both parks and so many amazing hikes for all difficulty levels. And of course, everybody loves r/redditlake/

That being said, if we're including Provincial Parks there are many in BC that (in my opinion) rival Banff/Jasper, albeit without the amenities and easy accessibility since you often have to hike to get to the areas you want to see. Garibaldi Provincial Park takes the cake with the famous Garibaldi Lake, the surrounding Panorama Ridge hike, and nearby Black Tusk for the adventurous. Also views of the potential active volcano Mt. Garibaldi. Plenty of other cool areas like Cheakamus, Wedgemount, and Elfin Lakes.",15,2021-12-21 07:24:26
hpfdt3l,t3_rl8ftz,MapleHamms,"My favourite is Elk Island in Alberta, I spent every weekend out there one summer. It’s not a popular choice but I think it’s amazing. Canoeing on a beautiful lake. Exploring various hiking trails. Encounters with two types of bisons. Beaver watching in the evening… I could go on.
Most of it is covered with forests of all kinds but it’s an amazing little place for anyone who wants to experience a relatively untouched slice of the prairies as it has some nice grassland too. 
Overall it’s a very relaxing place to spend a day if you’re a nature lover. And it’s only about 30-45 minutes away from Edmonton!",12,2021-12-21 14:24:53

Not many people have been there because it's extremely isolated. There are no roads anywhere *near* the place, as it's located on the northern tip of Labrador. So the only way to get there is to charter a flight from a small town way further south (which is also very isolated by the average Canadian standard).

Parks Canada recommends hiring an Inuit Bear Guard to escort you as the place is inundated with polar bears. There's a base camp/research station and they rely on electric fences to keep bears away from your tent.",11,2021-12-21 10:41:14

It contains the the Cabot Trail which is considered one of the world's most scenic destinations, with stunning ocean vistas, old-growth forests, prehistoric rock scarred by glaciers, and the mysterious Cape Breton Highlands. 

The scenery is spectacular, coastal mountains and picturesque fishing villages. There is plenty of salmon to catch, trails to explore and wildlife to be seen. The mountains are teeming with moose and bear. But it's the hospitality of the people that will sell you on the place.

Alexander Graham Bell once said,

“*I have travelled around the globe. I have seen the Canadian and American Rockies, the Andes, the Alps and the Highlands of Scotland, but for simple beauty, Cape Breton outrivals them all.*”

My dad drove long haul trucks in the area back in the day and we would go through this region a couple of times a year. We would stay at this roadside place but always make time to head out for a hike or try some fishing in the wilderness. Some of the best memories I have.",2,2021-12-21 23:40:05

ceorp5e,t1_ceoo4me,paxox,Green Gardens will take you about 6-8 hours to complete (if you do the full loop) and is perhaps the most beautiful day trail in the park.  I highly recommend doing the full loop.  It is about 16 kms and it fairly strenuous.  You will also have to ford 2 rivers to do the full loop.  The water can get high after rain.  Trout River Pond is also an excellent hike and is only 14 kms of fairly easy hiking.  Should take about 5 hours to complete.  Gros Morne Mountain is amazing and is fairly strenuous as well.  It will also take about 6-8 hours.  All these times will vary depending on how much time you want to absorb the scenery and your fitness level.  I live in NL and have traveled coast to coast and been to many of the National parks of Canada and Gros Morne is in my opinion perhaps the most beautiful of all of them.

Why I would say Banff specifically is because it is stunning (as are the others), but there's also a large variety of amenities at your finger tips that the others can't quite match.

You can have it both ways in a sense, mountain chalet chic and rugged adventure. Jasper would be my runner up, it has many amenities itself, while being totally stunning and a bit less touristy. The latter can work against you as well as for you though. Where the tourists go, there are services on offer.

Waterton would be my number 3. I love it. It's just smaller and without any resorts. But it's stunning and leans well enough into the adventure side. Then Yoho then Glacier, which are also gorgeous, but a little leaner on activities.

They've even installed dozens of campsites throughout that have toilets and all of its free as there's no entry fee or etc. Almost nobody lives in the region, there's like 5 houses on the lake that were claimed by doukhobors back in the old days but other than that the three towns opposite side of the lake have 2 thousand people between all of them so it's as in the wild while still being safe as you can get.

If you make it out to BC I'd recommend heading up to Garibaldi Provincial Park and hike to Garibaldi Lake. If you've got the energy/time I'd push to do Panorama Ridge while you're there (or Black Tusk). Needle Peak near Hope is a great hike with some incredible views and it's right along the Coquihalla. The Joffre Lakes are really nice but getting really overrun from what I've heard lately. There's a lot of great hikes around Vancouver itself like the West Lion or Lynn Canyon

You can camp right beside the lake at Garibaldi if you reserve a site (it's cheap). I would suggest camping considering the 8 hour round trip hike. You'll want to spend more than a few hours there.

dhjtoib,t3_6b1f61,[deleted],"fwiw.  Depends on where you are and how far you want to travel.

Tourist magnets are Jasper and Banff.  During tourist season: you could spend a month there and meet maybe three people; no one wants to talk, everyone wants to photobomb; it's nice once you get away from the bear jams and sheep (not the four legged variety) but, the pricks follow so you have put in some effort.  Off tourist season, it's very nice.  I like Canmore more.  imho, wells grey (bc prov), yoho, kootenay, and glacier are not left overs.

Elk Island, Grass Lands, cypress hills (interprov), big muddy (prov, castle butte) are interesting but I wouldn't burn a whole vac on them.  I'm indifferent to Riding.

Fathom five is a great stop if you dive.  Pukaskwa was a nice stop but I didn't really check out.

kouchibouguac has a nice beech and it's trails are pedestrian.  Great if you have kids in tow.  You can get lost in Fundy.  Which is a good thing.  A good mix and not over developed.

Cavendish is nice.

Cape Breton Highlands is nice.  But, imho, attracts pricks.  Louisburg is almost obligatory as it's so close to the ferry.

Gros Morne is a must visit.  Especially if you can swing a quad.

My wife and I have a goal of visiting at least one NP in every province and territory. 6 provinces/territories done, but we are somewhere in the teens for parks. 

From when I was in Ontario, I’d say Algonquin springs to mind for me first. For what seems like so much of the province’s population, people have an experience of Algonquin. The best camping trip I have ever had was on the Barron Canyon Trail, despite the access points being a lot farther than where I’d normally hit the park from SW Ontario.

I was at Badlands Provincial Park (AB) this past weekend, and could see a case for its inclusion, or Dinosaur’s, or a combination. The fossils and geology, and I would hazard the unique landscape would be an asset for their marketing materials.

And a selfish plug for Kananaskis, as I hear bad things of what is planned for the parks resources, and because I now pay for a pass for that park on top of my national park pass.

As it is highly unlikely that I would be coming in from the south, as when I head west to go to school, I usually fly, I would probably not do that exact itinerary, if anything, I would be more likely to head from north to south.",1,2018-03-21 13:52:29
elr6ej5,t3_bha34s,descendingangel87,"[Riding Mountain National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_Mountain_National_Park) in Manitoba. For where it is, and what it is, it's amazing and beautiful. Just search for it on google images and see just how amazing it looks. Not  mountains in the general sense, but instead they were created by glaciers during the last ice age. Home to numerous festivals and concerts its a pretty neat place.

A close second is [Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabasca_Sand_Dunes_Provincial_Park) in Saskatchewan. It is the worlds most northern active sand dunes and looks out of place considering how it is at the north end of the province.",9,2019-04-25 15:56:44

elrb3k0,t3_bha34s,AlanYx,"Gros Morne national park in Newfoundland is a real gem, particularly the tablelands, which have an otherworldly beauty. If you're a hiker, there's a backcountry hike you can do in Gros Morne called the Long Range Traverse that takes 3-4 days and consistently appears on lists of top hikes in the world. It's a goal of mine to do it some day; I know one person who did and absolutely loved it.

Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta doesn't get the same level of press as other parks in Alberta, but is absolutely worth the visit. I found taking the little tour to parts of the park that are generally off-limits to be one of the most spiritual experiences of my life. Dinosaur bone fragments are literally all around you. There's a shed with a simple building they've built over a site where a dinosaur is still half-buried in the ground, right where it fell eons ago. It's haunting and feels like a gravesite, not a museum, and makes you think about the sweeping arc of time.",5,2019-04-25 16:44:15
